    Welcome to the Alianza Public API documentation, based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

    _If you need the Swagger 2.0/OAS 2.0 version of the Alianza Public API, click [here](https://api.alianza.com/v2/apidocs/)._

    Authentication for most API endpoints requires the use of an <a href="data.html#xauthtoken" hidden>X-AUTH-TOKEN</a> X-AUTH-TOKEN header. Please reach out to your account manager for login credentials.
    To obtain an X-AUTH-TOKEN, use the POST /v2/authorize endpoint under the <a href="#/~operation/Authorize/">Authorize</a> group, which will return an authToken value. 
    Click the Authorize button below and provide the returned token.

      description: Use to retrieve information about telephone number availability.<br/><br/> This does NOT check whether a telephone number is currently in use somewhere in the system, with the aim of determining it can be assigned; rather, it checks that the partition is configured to work with the rate center to which the telephone number belongs.  If this reports no availability, but you are sure that the partition should be able to support the telephone number, please check the partition rate center setup.<br/><br/> This is most likely to be used in pre-validation of a telephone number port request; however, the porting flow documentation recommends use of another endpoint which accomplishes the same thing. While this endpoint is not officially deprecated, we do recommend you reference and use the other endpoint <a href="#/~operation/Rate%20Center%20Inventory/getRateCenter">here</a>.

For example, it usually instructs a device to immediately send 911, and can also help the phone determine that an extension is being dialed, so it should send after the extension length has been reached. These rules are encoded in a language of sorts and are only really understood by the phone itself.
